## Welcome

We are currently working on this comprehensive set of docs for getting started with the Supernotes API, but they are not ready yet. In the meantime, a complete API Reference can be found using your preferred OpenAPI spec below:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="RapiDoc" href="https://api.supernotes.app/docs/rapidoc"></Card>
  <Card title="ReDoc" href="https://api.supernotes.app/docs/redoc"></Card>
  <Card title="Swagger" href="https://api.supernotes.app/docs/swagger"></Card>
</CardGroup>

## Authentication

API keys can be used to interact with the Supernotes API, and are managed directly from your Supernotes account. To find them, start by clicking the User button, then > Settings > Manage Account > Manage API Keys. From there you can create, view, or delete API keys.

<Warning>
  Warning: API keys give full access to a Supernotes account. Anyone with an API
  key can create, edit, or delete any cards on that account.
</Warning>
