Enums are used in the API to define different values, here are the most common ones.

## Status

Declaring the status of various objects, most notably cards

```tsx
-2: Junked
-1: [only used internally]
0: Pending cards (inbox)
1: Unkept cards
2: Kept cards
```

## Visibility

Set whether a card is Priority (shown in the Outline), Visible (only shown in the Noteboard), or Invisible (by default hidden in the Noteboard and search results):

```tsx
enum Visibility {
  PRIORITY = 1
  VISIBLE = 0
  INVISIBLE = -1
}
```

## Roles & Perms

Set different roles and corresponding permissions on a card:

```tsx
enum Role {
  INHERIT = -1,
  NONE = 0,
  READER = 1318,
  CONTRIBUTOR = 1382,
  EDITOR = 1398,
  MODERATOR = 4094,
  AUTHOR = 8190,
}
```

```tsx
enum Perm {
  VIEW_COMMENTS = 2,
  ADD_COMMENT = 4,
  MANAGE_COMMENTS = 8,
  EDIT_DATA = 16,
  ADD_CHILDREN = 32,
  PUBLISH_CHILDREN = 64,
  MANAGE_PARENTS = 128,
  CREATE_SHARE_CODES = 256,
  MANAGE_SHARE_CODES = 512,
  VIEW_MEMBERS = 1024,
  MANAGE_MEMBERS = 2048,
  DELETE_FOR_EVERYONE = 4096,
}
```

## View Display Type

Set the Noteboard to be a certain view:

```tsx
enum ViewDisplayType {
  LIST = 1
  BROADSHEET = 2
  GRAPH = 4
}
```
